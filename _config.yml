    Hi, my name is Zamrony and I am a software developer. I have experience creating many types of applications, from desktop and Android mobile applications to web applications.

    I consider myself to be self-determined and adaptable. Thanks to my quick learning skills, I am able to take on fast-paced roles. For instance, I was given the task to learn AngularJS, a framework which I had practically no experience with. In just a few weeks, I was able to keep up with the team. I am also resourceful.

    In addition, I am versatile, friendly, and helpful to my colleagues. I like to assist fellow developers in various public forums, such as [answering this question in Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14054122/associate-an-object-with-marker-google-map-v2/39122553#39122553) or [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48738176/constraintlayout-how-to-align-centers-of-two-views-vertically/48738272#48738272). 
    I am an open-minded person who listens to others because I believe I can learn something from them.

    I started programming computers as a hobbyist. During my leisure time, I create and maintain several personal software projects. Some of these projects are open-source, such as the [Fano Framework](https://fanoframework.github.io), which is a web framework written in [Free Pascal](https://freepascal.org). 
    I have also created and maintain some [PHP Composer packages](https://packagist.org?query=juhara).

    I have written two books on Android and game programming topics, [Panduan Lengkap Pemrograman Android](https://andipublisher.com/produk/detail/panduan-lengkap-pemrograman-android) and [Pemrograman Game 3D dengan DirectX](https://andipublisher.com/produk/detail/pemrograman-game-3d-dengan-directx). I have also published Android [applications on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=juhara.com) to fulfill my curiosity about deploying and publishing Android applications.

          This is a web framework written in Pascal programming language. Initially,
          I started this project as a proof of concept for Pascal web framework that
          has capability to map request to a class instance that responsible for
          generating response.

          Since then, it has grown with many modern web framework features added such
          as middleware support, input validation, session management, etc.

          This is documentation for Fano Framework. I believe documentation is
          essential part of software library if you want other developer to use it.

          As Fano Framework grows in features, a single README.md documentation is no longer suffice.
          I started to realize I needed a separate project to maintain documentation for Fano Framework.

          This is command line tool for scaffolding Fano Framework web application.
          Fano Framework uses interfaces and class composition heavily.
          Fano Framework prefers configuration over convention. It
          requires a lot of boilerplate code to start web application project.

          Fano CLI is created to alleviate problem by automating project creation, creating controller, view,
          middleware etc.
