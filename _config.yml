    I think of myself as someone who is self-determined and adaptable. I have the ability to take on a fast-paced role thanks to my quick learning skills. I am resourceful.

    I am also versatile and friendly and helpful to my colleagues. I like to help fellow developers in many public forums such as [answering this question in Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14054122/associate-an-object-with-marker-google-map-v2/39122553#39122553).

    I started programming computer as hobbyist. On my leisure time, I create and maintain several personal software projects. Some projects are open-source project such as [Fano Framework](https://fanoframework.github.io) which is a web framework written in Free Pascal.

    I wrote two books on Android and game programming topics, [Panduan Lengkap Pemrograman Android](https://andipublisher.com/produk-panduan-lengkap-pemrograman-android) and *Pemrograman Game 3D dengan DirectX*. I published Android [applications on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=juhara.com) to fulfill my curiosity on how to deploy and publish Android application.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
